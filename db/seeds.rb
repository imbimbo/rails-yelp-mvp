# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end

# paris = Restaurant.create!(name: "Paris 6", category: "french", address: "Rua Haddock Lobo, 1240")
# mamma = Restaurant.create!(name: "Mamma mia", category: "italian", address: "Rua Ciao Bello , 2")
# verto = Restaurant.create!(name: "Vertogen", category: "belgian", address: "Av Bier Tho, 4")
# nihao = Restaurant.create!(name: "Nihao Ho", category: "chinese", address: "Rua Tsung The, 12")
# shoyu = Restaurant.create!(name: "Shoyu San", category: "japanese", address: "Av Kirin, 55")
# # tare = Restaurant.new(name: "Tare San", category: "japanese", address: "Av Bakayaro, 66").save
